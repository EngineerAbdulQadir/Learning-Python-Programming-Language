## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computers are very simple machines and only do what we tell them to. Hence, we learn programming to instruct computers to do what we are slower at â€” computation.

If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11.  
How about 23453453 X 56456?  
You will start searching for a calculator or open a new tab to calculate.

This 100 class of code series will help you learn Python from the start to the end. We will start from 0, and by the time we finish this course, I promise you will be a job-ready Python developer!

## What is Python?
- Python is a dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that supports both object-oriented and functional programming approaches.
- Python is an interpreted and high-level programming language.
- It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.

## Features of Python
- Python is simple and easy to understand.
- It is interpreted and platform-independent, which makes debugging very easy.
- Python is an open-source programming language.
- Python provides extensive library support. Some popular libraries include NumPy, TensorFlow, Selenium, and OpenCV.
- Python allows integration with other programming languages.

## What is Python used for
- Data Visualization: To create plots and graphical representations.
- Data Analytics: To analyze and extract insights from raw data.
- AI and Machine Learning: To simulate human behavior and learn from past data without explicit programming.
- Web Development: To build web applications.
- Database Handling: For managing and interacting with databases.
- Business and Accounting: To perform complex mathematical operations and quantitative/qualitative analysis.

## Why Replit?
- Replit makes it easy to share tutorials and code.
- You can easily fork this repl and continue learning at your own pace. The platform integrates video, code, and text tutorials on the same page, simplifying the learning process.
- For fellow teachers, you can create a `.tutorial` folder to develop tutorials using Replit.
