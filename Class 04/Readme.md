## Introduction
Today, we will write our first-ever Python program from scratch. It will consist of a bunch of print statements, which is a fundamental function in Python to display output.

## The `print()` Function
`print()` can be used to display text or other information on the console in Python. Here's a simple example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This line of code will output `Hello, World!` to the console.

## Quick Quiz
Write a program to print a poem in Python. Choose the poem of your choice and publish your Repl.

```python
print("---Your poem here---")
```

Make sure to complete this task. While it may seem easy for some of you, it's important to finish each and every assignment!
