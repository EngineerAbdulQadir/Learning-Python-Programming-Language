## Introduction
Welcome to Class 02 of our Python course! In this lesson, I'll be sharing my journey in learning Python and the exciting projects I've developed along the way.

## My Python Journey
I started learning Python at a young age, and now at 16, I can proudly say that it has been a transformative experience for me. Initially, I was curious about programming and wanted to create my own projects. As I delved into Python, I discovered a world of possibilities that allowed me to express my creativity and solve real-world problems. 

I found joy in building applications that were not only functional but also fun to use. Each project I undertook taught me something new and strengthened my coding skills. Here are some of the key projects that marked my journey:

## Projects I've Made

### 1. Jarvis VA
I created my own virtual assistant named Jarvis VA. It can perform various tasks such as setting reminders, searching the web, and managing my schedule. This project taught me about natural language processing and how to work with APIs.

### 2. Love Calculator
This fun project calculates the compatibility between two names based on a simple algorithm. It was a great way to practice my coding skills and learn about string manipulation and user input.

### 3. Face Recognition
In this project, I implemented face recognition using Python and OpenCV. It was fascinating to explore computer vision and machine learning concepts, and I learned how to train a model to recognize faces in images.

### 4. Flappy Bird
I developed a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game using Python and the Pygame library. This project helped me understand game development principles, including game loops, collision detection, and user input handling.

### 5. Snake Game
Another classic game I built is the Snake Game. It was a fun way to reinforce my understanding of programming logic, and I enjoyed adding features like score tracking and increasing difficulty levels.
